# eazy HASH
It was a little bit difficult to implement RIPEMD160,SHA3_384,SHA3_512,SHA3_256.Because they are not implemented in System.Cryptography from the dotnet framework. So i had to use the Bouncy Castle library which is not native to dotnet.

AI agents , as chat gpt and copilot were used to build this app. But i revised the code myself so it is working and it is readable by humans.
