# eazy HASH
It was a pain in the ass to implement RIPEMD160,SHA3_384,SHA3_512,SHA3_256.Because they are not implemented in System.Cryptography from the dotnet framework. So i had to use the Bouncy Castle library which is not native to dotnet.

thanks,Oros(he is my teacher, and this was one of the homeworks that he gave us at the cryptography lab)

Anyway,i implemented things myself but i think it is foolish to not use chatgpt and copilot.Anyway, i tried making the code as human and as readable as possible for everyone.Enjoy!

PS(this is not a pretty app, but it does the job and is asynchronous)
